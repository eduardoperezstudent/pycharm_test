Step-by-Step Summary: Pushing a PyCharm Project to GitHub
Step 1: Initialize Git in Your Project

    Open Your Project in PyCharm:
        Make sure your project is open in PyCharm.

    Enable Git Version Control:
        Go to VCS > Enable Version Control Integrationâ€¦.
        Select Git from the dropdown and click OK.

Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository

    Go to GitHub:
        Visit GitHub and log in to your account.

    Create a New Repository:
        Click on the New button to create a new repository.
        Enter a repository name (e.g., my-pycharm-project).
        Leave the repository empty (do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license).

Step 3: Add the Remote Repository in PyCharm

    Open Terminal in PyCharm:
        Go to View > Tool Windows > Terminal.

    Add the Remote URL:
        Run the following command to link your local project to the GitHub repository:

    bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your GitHub details.

Verify the Remote URL:

    Run:

bash

    git remote -v

    This should display the remote URLs for fetch and push.

Step 4: Stage and Commit Your Changes

    Check Git Status:
        Run:

    bash

git status

    This will show the status of your files (tracked, untracked, and changes).

Stage All Changes:

    Run:

bash

git add .

    This stages all changes (new files and modifications).

Commit the Changes:

    Run:

bash

    git commit -m "Initial commit with project files"

Step 5: Push Your Changes to GitHub

    Push to the Remote Repository:
        Run:

    bash

git push -u origin master

    If your default branch is main, use:

bash

    git push -u origin main

    Authenticate with GitHub (if prompted):
        Enter your GitHub credentials or a Personal Access Token if 2FA is enabled.

Step 6: Verify on GitHub

    Check Your Repository on GitHub:
        Go to your repository URL on GitHub:

    arduino

https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

    Ensure your files and commits are visible.
